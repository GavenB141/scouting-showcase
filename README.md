# Scouting App Showcase

https://scouting.gavenbehrends.com

### What is this?
From 2019 - 2023 I was a member of FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) Team 1710. It is common practice in FRC to conduct "scouting" on other teams to inform future strategy, often using a custom scouting app. For the 2023 season I took charge of our scouting app, and migrated the project from vanilla PHP on shared hosting to a serverless SvelteKit app.

**This repository aims to showcase key aspects of the UI while remaining separate from the real thing and without using backend resources.** 

### What am I looking at?
The app is made for CHARGED UP, the game designed for 2023. For context, you can see the official animation showcasing the game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zpflsYc4PA) and the full game manual [here](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2023/Manual/2023FRCGameManual.pdf). If you'd like to try it yourself, you can look up videos of real matches.

It's designed for team members to scout from the audience using their phones. Behind the scenes, user input is recorded as a series of actions along with timestamps based on the timing of input. Obviously times aren't expected to be spot on, but the UI is designed to flow smoothly, with a layout that intuitively mirrors the game. This makes it easy for scouts to quickly record actions as they happen.
