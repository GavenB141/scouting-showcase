# Scouting App Showcase

https://scouting.gavenbehrends.com/about

### What is this?
From 2019 - 2023 I was a member of FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) Team 1710. It is common practice in FRC to conduct "scouting" on other teams to inform future strategy, often using a custom scouting app. For the 2023 season I took charge of our scouting app, and migrated the project from vanilla PHP on shared hosting to a serverless SvelteKit app.

**This repository aims to showcase key aspects of the UI while remaining separate and without using backend resources**
